Pour in the rest of the dashi stock and bring to a simmer. Once simmering, add in onion and let it simmer for 3 minutes. (optional)
Add rice cake and cook for another 5-6 minutes; make sure that all the rice cake is soaked in the sauce.
Finally, add in any toppings of your choice, I like fish cake and cabbage, and simmer for another 3-4 minutes.
Add 1 cup of cheese and broil it in the oven till cheese is melted, or cover with a lid on so the cheese fully melts.

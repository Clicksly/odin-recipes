> This is a simple web development project to exercise and demonstrate an industry relevant skillset. This project demonstrates planning and problem solving skills along with essential technical web dev skills, including proficiency in both HTML and Git. Recipes are modified versions of reciepes sourced from Tiffy Cooks. I cook a lot using her recipes and I enjoy them very much!

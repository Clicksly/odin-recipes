        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup flour</li>
        <li>1/3 cup cold water</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups Panko</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Black Pepper Japanese Curry</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Onions, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>1 pack Japanese curry cubes</li>
        <li>2 tbsp black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>Cooked Rice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Start by slicing small cuts through the fat of the pork chop so it doesn’t curl up when frying. Use the back of your knife to gently flatten the pork to help tenderize it, then shape it back with your hands. Season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix together flour, cold water, and two eggs until smooth. The batter should be thick but still easy to mix. Add more flour or water as needed until it looks right.</li>
        <li>Coat the pork chop in the batter, then press it into panko breadcrumbs. Make sure every part is fully covered. Press it down so the panko sticks really well.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a pan. Test if it’s ready by dropping in a little panko in the pan. it should float and sizzle in about 5 seconds. Fry the pork chop for 3–4 minutes on each side or until it’s crispy and golden brown. Let it rest on a paper towel.</li>
        <li>In another pan, sauté sliced onions with some oil and butter on medium heat for about 10 minutes or until soft and caramelized.</li>
        <li>Pour in water and bring it to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Once it starts bubbling, mix in your Japanese curry cubess and stir until fully melted.</li>
        <li>Let everything simmer for about 10 minutes, or until the sauce thickens to your liking.</li>
        <li>Serve over hot rice.</li>
    </ol>
